# uhe To-Do List

**This skin needs the [uhe suite](https://github.com/Joehuu/uhe) in the same `Rainmeter/Skins` folder to work correctly.**

Simple Rainmeter to-do list skin based on [Pernickety/rainmeter-todo-list](https://github.com/Pernickety/rainmeter-todo-list).

## Installing

* Download and place entire `uhe-todo-list` and [`uhe`](https://github.com/Joehuu/uhe) folder in your Rainmeter skins location
* Activate `uhe-todo-list` skin
    * Do this by right-clicking on an already active skin to bring up the Rainmeter menu
    * Navigate to `Rainmeter > Skins > uhe-todo-list > todo > todo.ini`
        * If you do not see `uhe-todo-list` in the skin selection, try navigating to `Rainmeter > Refresh all`
